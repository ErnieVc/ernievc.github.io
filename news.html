    <h2>Avengers 4: Time-traveling movie?</h2>

        <p>Principal photography for Avengers 4 began on August 2017, and some leaked pictures of the production have been circulating for the past weeks, and from the looks of them, it seems like Time-travel will have a prominent role in the movie. Some pictures show Captain America, Ironman and other avengers in their Avengers 1 outfits. This would be the first Marvel movie in which time travel plays a very prominent role (not counting Dr.Strange time-stone scenes). 
        Even though the web's prominent theory for these pictures is time-travel, there could be other theories. Maybe those pictures are from flashback or maybe the avengers have gone back to wearing their original costumes. We would have to wait to see for ourselves when the movie comes out. Avengers 4 is expected to be in theaters on May 3, 2019.</p>

        <p>After the controversial production of Justice League, and it's underwhelming box office performance, the future of the DCEU(DC Extended Universe) seemed in jeopardy. A lot of rumors and expeculations started to surface about the differences between Zack Snyder and Warner Brothers, movies being pushed back or cancelled, and others. Despite of it all, one thing that Justice League got right was building up each one of the characters, especially Aquaman. Aquaman has been given stereotyped as a corny soft man that talks to fish and rides dolphins. This has been the case for all of these years, especially because of the popular Super Friends animated show. Justice League succeded at changing  people's mind about Aquaman. Jason Momoa gave us a "cool-surfer bro" Aquaman that became one of the highlights of the movie. Now, the trailer for the movie has been released, and it seems to be a very ambitious project with more of what we loved about Jason Momoa's aquaman.<br>
            Here is the trailer: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaWnLiffxJ4&t" target="_blank">Aquaman Trailer</a>

        <p> Here at V Cinematics we enjoy sharing our love for movies and our purpose is to continue cultivating that love for movies as an artform. Also, we understand that each one of us has different tastes. Some may be strongly bothered by violence or profanity in movies, and some may not mind. This is why we value the importance of becoming familiar with film and TV show ratings. These ratings are provided by the <b>Motion Picture Association of America film rating system (MPAA)</b> and the <strong>TV parental guidelines</strong>. We want to make sure that you are aware of what kind of content you can expect from movies or TV shows. We strongly recommend everyone, especially parents, to become familiar with the rating system, so that they can adjust/filter their entertainment accoding to their taste, if they desire to do so.
